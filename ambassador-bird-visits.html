          A Visit from an Ambassador Bird
        </h2>
        <p class="l-pb-1-5 ">
          If you’re an educator, community outreach group, or organization
          putting on an event and you would like to have MARS ambassador birds
          attend, please fill out the short form below.

        <p class="l-pb-1-5 ">
          Part of the MARS mission is to spread the word about the protection
          and preservation of wildlife and habitats on northern Vancouver Island
          and so we love it when the public — particularly young people — can
          experience our majestic hawk and owls up close, with the
          interpretative support of our bird handlers.
        </p>
        <p class="l-pb-3 ">
          Our goal is always to release sick or injured animals into the wild
          after they have recovered, but that isn’t always possible. For various
          reasons, our Ambassadors are permanent residents of MARS. They travel
          to classrooms and the wider community with a volunteer bird handler to
          act as “spokesbirds” for all wildlife.

              Seeing an owl or hawk up close can be an exciting experience. A

                Sometimes birds “bate” or fly off the glove. This is also a
                surprise. Because the bird is attached to the handler by leather
                straps, this is more flapping than flying and doesn’t hurt the
                bird.

              <li class="c-card__list-item-check">

          Some of the raptors who have become Ambassadors suffered devastating
          injuries that prevented them from being returned to the wild, while
          others have become habituated to humans for various reasons. All have
          found new purpose helping to educate the public about wild nature. To
          keep these raptors, MARS applied for permits and continues to meet
          government regulations for their appropriate care.

              Marlowe came to MARS in the fall of 2019 after hitting a window in
              Comox in the middle of the night. The home owners found him and
              brought him to our wildlife hospital the next day. He showed many
              signs of severe head trauma, and we weren’t sure if he could even
              see properly. He showed no threat avoidance, and was extremely
              docile.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              He saw several vets who determined there was no reason Marlowe
              should not be able to see, and that it was most likely the head
              trauma that was causing him not to react to movement or oncoming
              threats. He struggled to eat for the first several months with us,
              and progressed from being force-fed, to handfed, to eventually
              eating on his own without any help from the caregivers.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              Marlowe has progressed a great deal since arriving with us as a
              patient, but nowhere near enough to be successfully released into
              the wild. He gets his name from Christopher Marlowe who was William
              Shakespeare’s friend, collaborator, and (at times) rival.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-3">
              Marlowe is a very gentle bird who was born in the spring of 2019,
              with an expected lifespan of upwards of 20 years in captivity. He
              typically weighs about 600 – 700 grams, and eats two mice a day.

            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              Lanei arrived at MARS in March 2015 from a research and captive
              breeding program for Western Screech Owls in Northern BC when he was
              about 2 years old. These birds are threatened and are protected
              under the federal Species at Risk Act. Lanei is non-releasable due
              to his inability to hunt or protect himself from predators. MARS’
              late Ambassador Screech Owl, Otus Jr., was also from this same
              program.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              Lanei can be resistant to go to “work” and will hang upside down

              Horus is a Red-tailed Hawk named after the falcon-headed Egyptian
              god of the same name. She was found in 2008 hanging around the
              Quinsam River Hatchery near Campbell River where she was begging for
              food and in poor physical condition. When she was approached by one
              of our bird handlers, she jumped to the glove, indicating she was
              imprinted to humans and probably raised in captivity.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              When she was brought to MARS, she was emaciated and suffered from
              bumblefoot, a type of infection which prevented her from bending her
              toes to perch or catch prey. MARS developed a cream to cure her foot
              issue. She is also prone to feather damage as she may not have had a
              “Mom” to teach her feather maintenance.

              Horus is a healthy older bird whose dramatic nature appeals to all
              visitors. She is at least 14 years old with a life expectancy of 20
              years. She eats half a quail each day and weighs about 1.3 kg.

              Humpty was a pre-fledgling found at the base of a tree and thought
              to be dead. Five days later he was found to be moving and MARS was
              called in for rescue. As he had suffered a great fall, his finders

              Upon admission he was found to be suffering from severe dehydration

              within his first year at MARS. It is also believed that he has some
              mental deficit due to his early injuries. He seldom vocalizes and
              his flight remains uncertain. His diet consists of poultry, fish and
              deer meat and he weighs about 3-3.5 kg.

              Hyacinth fell from her nest as a pre-fledgling when her nest fell
              apart. MARS was called and went by boat to the site at Hyacinth Cove
              on Quadra Island to rescue her.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              She suffered multiple fractures in her right wing that were too
              close to the shoulder to be pinned so her wing was taped for 4
              weeks. When another eagle accidentally bumped into her later, the
              wing was re-fractured. It eventually did heal but has a slight curve
              in the humerus so she is unable to “soar like an eagle”.

              the company of other eagle patients when they are housed together.
              Her diet consists of poultry, fish and deer meat and she weighs
              about 3.5 – 4.0 kg.

              Siblings Nimpkish and Kokish arrived as juvenile birds in the summer
              of 2020. Finders reported that they were being aggressively mobbed
              by other crows. Kokish (female, on the right) had a greenstick
              fracture of the tibiotarsus, a leg bone. Her brother Nimpkish was
              brought to our hospital the next day as the attacks continued.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              These distinctive birds are albinos, meaning they do not possess the
              pigments that would make their feathers, skin, beak, and eyes black.
              This genetic condition also results in very weak eyesight, extreme
              sensitivity to light, and poor depth perception, making it difficult
              for them to find food and protect themselves. Their feathers are
              easily damaged as they are missing the melanin that contributes both
              colour and strength. Because their feathers reflect light, albino
              birds have difficulty staying warm in winter. All these factors lead
              to a veterinarian determining that the pair would have the best
              quality of life by becoming Ambassadors at MARS.
            </p>
            <p class="l-pb-1-5">
              Their names reflect their origin: these crows were born in the
              traditional territory of the ‘Namgis First Nation on northern
              Vancouver Island, which encompasses the Nimpkish and Kokish
              watersheds.

                Sawyer had been with MARS since August of 2014 when he sustained
                damage to his right wing, possibly due to a cat attack. The damage
                to his wing was severe and the entire wing was surgically
                amputated. Because of his injuries he could not be released, so
                was adopted into the MARS ambassador family.

              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                In 2016 Sawyer’s right eye became inflamed and even though it was

                As a MARS ambassador, our little one-winged, one-eyed owl was

              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Sawyer’s job was to educate the public about owls and other
                wildlife, and help visitors feel a connection to the natural
                world. In the six years he spent as part of this program, he made
                an impact on the lives of hundreds of people of different ages
                from all over the Valley and beyond. He passed peacefully at MARS
                in late January 2021 due to old age, surrounded by those who loved
                him.

              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Otus Jr. was the offspring of one of our previous ambassador owls
                who had participated in a captive breeding program for the
                threatened Western Screech Owl. Once the program was no more, Otus
                and his roommate, Lanei, were sent to MARS to live out their lives
                because they would not be able to fend for themselves in the wild.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Otus joined the MARS family in 2014 and became a mainstay of our
                education program. He visited local classrooms, attended community
                events, and did many on-site presentations during his lifetime. He
                was always content to get out and sit on the glove of a handler,
                many of whom shared an incredible bond with him. Handlers would
                often find Otus with his ear tufts up, ready to have a chat when
                they entered his enclosure to catch him up for his working day. He
                had a huge impact on all of us at MARS and had many fans out in
                the community.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                In the end stages of his life, Otus became very ill with severe
                internal infections. After visits to several different vets and a
                number of tests that showed an increasingly poor prognosis, we
                decided that humane euthanasia was the kindest option for little
                Otus. He passed away at MARS in early February 2021, surrounded by
                those who loved and cared for him.

              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Shakespeare was hit by a car in 2003. He lost his left eye,
                fractured his beak and sternum, and had hearing loss on one side.
                He spent a year and a half in rehabilitation at the Orphaned
                Wildlife Rehabilitation Society in Delta, British Columbia
                (O.W.L.). His injuries would prevent him from fending for himself
                in the wild so it was not possible to release him.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Originally, Shakespeare was adopted by MARS as a foster parent to
                younger Barred Owls but he wasn’t very good in this role. He
                started training to become an Ambassador bird in 2006 and made his
                first public appearance six months later. He could often be heard
                calling to local wild owls late in the day, even making “howler
                monkey” calls on occasion. His diet was mostly quail and mice.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Over the 17 years he spent at MARS, Shakey touched the lives of
                thousands of people, helped with many events and school
                presentations, and bonded strongly with several of his handlers.
                He made a huge impact on the community during his time with us,
                and we are so grateful he was able to live out his life happily
                with us here at MARS.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Shakespeare developed liver disease and lung issues towards the
                end of his life and was humanely euthanized in March of 2023. He
                passed in the arms of his favourite handler.

              <div class="hidden-content">
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Brinley was in full adult plumage when she was hit by a car in the
                Lower Mainland in 2005. Her right wing was so badly damaged that
                part of it had to be amputated. She was initially at the Vancouver
                Aquarium, then The Raptors in Duncan. As a non-flighted bird she
                needed a more suitable home for the long-term and thankfully, Maj
                and the team at MARS welcomed her in as an ambassador.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Jo, one of our caregivers, said: “Brinley was a force to be
                reckoned with. She chose whom to connect with and was the dominant
                partner in the relationship. Brinley lost the ability to be the
                apex predator of the night sky but never lost the attitude.” All
                of those that had the honour of having a progressing relationship
                with Brinley saw it as an immense privilege.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                Great horned owls are known to have incredibly strong feet but
                those that worked with her on the glove claim she was the gentlest
                bird. She touched many lives while attending events and
                presentations, and became a regular to visit on our ambassador
                tour after her retirement. Her presence was truly amazing.
              </p>
              <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                We at MARS have had the absolute pleasure of working with Brinley,
                such an incredible species and personality. May she enjoy her
                final freedom in the skies.
