<div class="l-grid-two">
  <p class="l-pb-1-5">
    The current medical facility is very much a hospital and the
    mammals and birds are very much patients. As far as possible, they
    are extended the same courtesies a human patient would receive
    because privacy, peace, and quiet are essential to wildlife
    recovery. For this reason, we don’t allow the general public
    access to our patients in the hospital.
  </p>
  <p class="l-pb-1-5">
    MARS wildlife caregivers also follow strict protocols to ensure
    the lowest level of human-wildlife interaction possible in order
    to prevent imprinting or habituation. We want wild nature to stay
    wild. Our waterfowl, deer, and racoon enclosures are not
    accessible to the public.
  </p>
  <p class="l-pb-1-5">
    The enclosures in the Mews (outdoor viewing area) are designed for
    the safety, security, and privacy of our resident Ambassador
    Birds. We encourage quiet observation of these birds. We ask
    visitors to understand that our raptors are not always easy to see
    as they will perch in the most secluded corner of their homes.
  </p>
  <p class="l-pb-1-5">
    We encourage the public to help with the rescue of injured
    wildlife by bringing small species to us, or to a veterinarian.
    With large or dangerous wildlife such as Bald Eagles or Great Blue
    Heron, our trained staff and volunteers will respond.

                  MARS Wildlife Rescue founder, Mary Jane Birch, known to many as
                  “Maj”, and her husband Keith were both keenly engaged in the
                  protection and preservation of wildlife and habitat in the Comox
                  Valley. Maj worked tirelessly to rescue, rehabilitate, and release
                  injured wildlife, while Keith built cages to house them all. Maj
                  drew people with the same concern for wildlife rehabilitation to
                  work beside her as volunteers in the early days. It was a shared
                  passion for both Maj and Keith for many years.

              <p class="l-pb-3">
                Mountainaire Avian Rescue Society —still our legal name— began on
                their pretty, forested three-acre property in rural Merville,
                British Columbia. Maj applied for and received federal and
                provincial permits to rehabilitate wildlife in 1993; two years
                later the society was registered as a provincial and federal
                non-profit charity. Keith died in 2008 after a lengthy illness.
                His efforts left a legacy that helped MARS grow from treating 100
                to 200 patients annually to over 600 at the original location,
                before the planned move in 2017 to our new home at 1331 Williams

                <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                  Maj dreamed of building a better facility on a larger property
                  that could treat more birds and mammals, while also acting as an
                  education centre. She wanted to teach the public—particularly
                  young people and children—the importance of preserving and
                  protecting the wildlife and habitat of the Comox Valley and
                  northern Vancouver Island.
                </p>
                <p class="l-pb-1-5">
                  Our present 11-acre property was purchased in early 2015, with the
                  assistance of a substantial bequest from the Woodrow family. After
                  much planning and installation of services, the new MARS Wildlife
                  Hospital began receiving patients in May 2017 and our Visitor
                  Centre opened in June 2019. Our volunteers and donors—individuals,
                  community groups, and corporate sponsors—have helped us add
                  treatment areas to our hospital, build enclosures for resident and
                  recovering animals, and construct a substantial, multi-area flight
                  pen for recovering eagles and smaller birds.

                <p class="l-pb-3">
                  In her will, Maj left a substantial bequest to MARS Wildlife
                  Rescue to help her dreams along. With the continued support of the
                  local community, our generous donors, and dedicated volunteers, we
                  are working to fulfill her dreams and create a legacy for our
                  communities that will ensure wildlife is protected and wild
                  habitats are preserved through public education at the Visitor
                  Centre.

                  As the property improvements proceed, we are making habitat
                  preservation and recovery a priority. We are providing wildlife
                  corridors through the property by not adding fences which would
                  prevent transit to grazing areas. From a seasonally dry pond, we
                  have created wet habitat for the wild things. Our wetland area is
                  visited by ducks and heron, and deer come to drink. Even our local
                  bear wanders by in the evening. This area has also seen a species
                  of concern, the Red-legged Frog. We had tadpoles in the pools in
                  the spring of 2019 and are hopeful for their continued return. In
                  short, we are trying to provide habitat to our wild neighbours.
                </p>
                <p class="l-pb-3">
                  Over the years, MARS has witnessed an exponential increase in the
                  number of animals and birds that come through our doors. In 2021,
                  volunteers and staff tended to over 1400 patients and are
                  expecting to surpass that total this year. By far the main reason
                  for our growing caseload is human expansion into traditional
                  wildlife habitats. Simply put, all of us are interacting with wild
                  nature far more often than we used to, and MARS is seeing more
                  patients as a result.

            donations, large and small, individual and corporate, one-time and
            monthly.

            Please consider donating to our ongoing efforts to rehabilitate and
            release local wildlife through Canada Helps. Our patients increase
            in number every year. Material donations are welcomed, too. MARS
