                        most of Pearl’s work life was dedicated to law reform
                        activities to protect the rights of people. After a
                        Snowy Owl led Pearl to MARS, she joined the board of

                        Pearl spent every possible moment outside. Just beyond
                        the door was this fascinating and vibrant world of
                        plants and forests filled with the sound of bird calls
                        and insects buzzing, leaving her with a lifelong feeling
                        of connectedness to nature and a need for wildness.

                        she learned as a caregiver, going on to obtain her Basic

                        that one day she wanted to be able to give back to MARS.

                        Linda was raised on a farm and has always loved to spend
                        time outdoors with the dogs and cats. After a career in
                        the public service as a busy and stressed out executive,
                        she and her partner came to the Comox Valley to retire
                        and enjoy doing things they never had enough time for.
                        For Linda, this included finding a way to help animals –
                        something she has been looking to do since a young age.

                        When she saw an Ambassador bird at one of the local
                        events, she knew MARS might be a good fit. Linda has
                        been a volunteer wildlife caregiver since January 2022
                        and also did some guiding with the Visitor Centre over
                        the spring and summer. She joined the board of directors
                        in October 2022. While the baby racoons have become her
                        favourite wild furry critters, she is in awe of the
                        raptors. With a name like “Hawk”, you kind of have to
                        be!

                        not to come back until dinner was ready. Along the way
                        she developed a love of the outdoors and all the beauty
                        it held. It also helped that every orphaned or injured
                        animal, whether domesticated or wild, would gravitate to
                        her front door step, where her mom would care for them.

                        quickly became repair and maintenance of the enclosures

                  <div class="hidden-content">
                    <p class="l-pt-2">
                      Born and raised in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Megan always
                      knew she wanted to work with animals. After graduating the
                      University of Saskatchewan with a biology degree and a
                      specialization in anatomy and conservation, she spent a
                      number years doing internships at multiple wildlife
                      rehabilitation centres in North and Central America,
                      including Belize, Texas, and Toronto. She has worked with a
                      number of local and exotic species, a favourite of which is
                      howler monkeys.
                    </p>
                    <p class="l-pt-2">
                      After interning for 6 months at Toronto Wildlife Centre, she
                      was hired on full time, where she spent the next 5 years,
                      working up to senior supervisor. At the end of 2022, she
                      decided she was sick of the craziness of Toronto, and moved
                      with her cat, Shadow, to Vancouver Island to be closer to
                      her family. Megan is an avid birder, and often is outside
                      trying to spot any kind of wildlife she can.

                      Melissa joined MARS as staff in 2022, but previously was
                      welcomed early in 2021 to intern. She then soon returned for
                      a summer assistant position.
                    </p>
                    <p class="l-pt-2">
                      Born and raised in Medicine Hat, AB, Melissa’s most
                      enjoyable memories came from the scenic Cypress Hill’s where
                      a fascination in forest ecology developed. Her main
                      interests in biology and psychology led her to a bachelor’s
                      degree from the University of Lethbridge where she focused
                      in ecology and animal behaviour. While research was the
                      forefront of her job search, Melissa found herself working
                      in public education along with various animal work. In
                      addition to rehabilitation in Alberta, she has been involved
                      with sanctuary wolfdog care, aquatic invasive species
                      inspections, and northern goshawk surveys.

                    <p class="l-pt-2">
                      As a Biologist in Training, Melissa is also excited about
                      fieldwork, including ecological monitoring and restoration.
                      She is passionate about native species and our ability to
                      cultivate suitable homes for the wildlife around us. Melissa
                      is aspiring to become a Certified Wildlife Rehabilitator and
                      working towards this goal. While she is fascinated by all
                      species and their behaviours, her heart melts for sea and
                      shorebirds, waterfowl, mustelids, canids, and owls.

                      A long-time resident of the Comox Valley, Aaron grew up with
                      a great appreciation of the outdoors and everything in it.
                      He is currently enrolled at North Island College in biology
                      after a few years out of academia. Aaron is hoping to
                      complete a Bachelor of Science (Zoology) program at UBC in
                      the near future. While technically the volunteer and
                      education coordinator in the Visitor Centre, Aaron is never
                      one to sit still. He has his hand in whatever he can do at
                      MARS, from helping in the hospital to coordinating our
                      refundables, and from working with Ambassador Birds to
                      assisting with construction.
