        For most people, helping wildlife in distress is a natural reaction.

        intervention may be necessary.

        MARS wildlife rehabilitators will assess the situation and determine

          If a rescue is necessary, injured wild birds can be rounded up and
          captured using a towel, blanket, or piece of clothing. Place the
          towel over the bird, covering their head, and gently scoop them up.

        <p class="l-mt-2">
          Mammals and birds of prey, such as owls and eagles, can be very
          dangerous to handle without prior training and experience, so please
          call MARS before you put the animal or yourself at risk.
        </p>
        <p class="l-mt-2">
          If you have captured an animal, handle them as little as possible.
          Even if they appear calm, cuddling and human contact is extremely
          stressful to wildlife and may even kill them. Put the animal in a
          cardboard box or other container with air holes and keep them in a
          warm, dark, quiet place, away from children and pets. Never give
          wildlife food or water unless instructed by a wildlife
          rehabilitator.

        <p class="l-mt-2">
          The MARS Wildlife Hospital is open 7 days a week. It is tremendously
          helpful if you can transport the animal to us, but if that isn’t
          possible please call to arrange for a volunteer to pick it up. The
          less time it takes for the animal to get here, the better its
          chances of successful rehabilitation! Remember it is illegal to keep
          wildlife in your possession for more than 24 hours.

                Many young birds found during the spring and summer months are in
                the process of “fledging” or leaving the nest and it’s normal for
                them to be on the ground for several days before they learn how to
                fly. Usually the fledgling’s parents are nearby and will return
                periodically to feed and protect their young. Unfortunately, many of
                these happy healthy fledglings are “kidnapped” by well-meaning
                members of the public who think they are injured!

                    Nestlings are baby birds that have recently hatched and are not
                    yet ready to leave the nest. They are blind and naked or covered
                    with short pinfeathers and some fluff. Nestlings are unable to
                    stand up, hop, or perch. They are totally vulnerable and rely on
                    mom and dad for food and warmth. If you find a healthy nestling
                    on the ground, try to locate the nest nearby. If the nest is
                    intact, you can put the nestling back. It is a myth that bird
                    parents will abandon their babies if a human has handled them!
                    Make sure to put them back in the right nest — check for other
                    siblings of the same age and species. Then watch from a distance
                    to make sure that the parents return within 2 hours.

                    Fledglings are baby birds that have developed enough that they
                    are ready to leave the nest but cannot fly. They are almost
                    fully feathered, but the tail and wing feathers are too short
                    for flight. Fledglings are able to stand up and hop and are
                    learning to perch. They are much more independent than nestlings
                    but still rely on mom and dad for food. If you find a healthy
                    fledgeling on the ground, you can move it a short distance to a
                    safer location, but otherwise please leave them alone. Being on
                    the ground is a natural event – it doesn’t matter how many times
                    you put fledglings back in the nest, they will jump back out.
                    This is an important stage in their development, during which
                    the parents will teach them how to find food and recognize
                    predators. Watch from a distance to make sure that the parents

                    Brancher is another term for a fledgling. Owl and other raptor
                    fledglings are often called branchers because rather than
                    jumping to the ground after leaving the nest, they will perch on
                    a branch nearby. Like fledglings, they are still unable to fly
                    so can be mistaken for a bird in distress.

      not have a scent so is difficult for predators to locate by smell.

              Many young birds found during the spring and summer months are in
              the process of “fledging” or leaving the nest and it’s normal for
              them to be on the ground for several days before they learn how to
              fly. Usually the fledgling’s parents are nearby and will return
              periodically to feed and protect their young. Unfortunately, many
              of these happy healthy fledglings are “kidnapped” by well-meaning
              members of the public who think they are injured!

                Nestlings are baby birds that have recently hatched and are not
                yet ready to leave the nest. They are blind and naked or covered
                with short pinfeathers and some fluff. Nestlings are unable to
                stand up, hop, or perch. They are totally vulnerable and rely on
                mom and dad for food and warmth. If you find a healthy nestling
                on the ground, try to locate the nest nearby. If the nest is
                intact, you can put the nestling back. It is a myth that bird
                parents will abandon their babies if a human has handled them!
                Make sure to put them back in the right nest — check for other
                siblings of the same age and species. Then watch from a distance
                to make sure that the parents return within 2 hours.

                Fledglings are baby birds that have developed enough that they
                are ready to leave the nest but cannot fly. They are almost
                fully feathered, but the tail and wing feathers are too short
                for flight. Fledglings are able to stand up and hop and are
                learning to perch. They are much more independent than nestlings
                but still rely on mom and dad for food. If you find a healthy
                fledgeling on the ground, you can move it a short distance to a
                safer location, but otherwise please leave them alone. Being on
                the ground is a natural event – it doesn’t matter how many times
                you put fledglings back in the nest, they will jump back out.
                This is an important stage in their development, during which
                the parents will teach them how to find food and recognize
                predators. Watch from a distance to make sure that the parents
                return within 2 hours.

                    Brancher is another term for a fledgling. Owl and other raptor
                    fledglings are often called branchers because rather than
                    jumping to the ground after leaving the nest, they will perch on
                    a branch nearby. Like fledglings, they are still unable to fly
                    so can be mistaken for a bird in distress.

              Do not assume that a lone fawn is abandoned. When the mother deer
              is off foraging for food, she often leaves her young behind,
              sometimes for several hours. The fawn knows to stay still and
              quiet and does not have a scent so is difficult for predators to
              locate by smell. Please never touch a fawn with your bare hands –
              this transfers your scent and makes it easy for predators to find.

              bat population of BC is a carrier of the virus. Bats are nocturnal,
              and will often find odd places to roost during the day or over
              winter during hibernation,often on sides of buildings, inside patio
              umbrellas, or even inside wood piles.
